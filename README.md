This is an interpreter that I have created for[Blarg's Fancy Flight Info.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=907619446)  
I have created it based on the tutorial provided [here](http://blargmode.se/ffi-guide/)although at the  
moment I have only implemented basic shapes and text. My intention is  
for this to enable faster and easier modification of in game LCD-screens  
by providing a larger self-updating view of designs. Blarg's Fancy Flight  
Info is an incredibly useful script however can take an extremely long time  
to create overly-complex designs. This is not a failing of the script but  
rather a result of the fact that designs can only be created using a text  
based interface. I hope that my program will help uncover the true potential  
of this brilliant little script.
